# Magento 2 Storefront Keyboard Hotkeys

This module enables hotkeys for a store's main functionality.

## Purpose

The purpose of these hotkeys is to **increase accessibility** to those with limited mobility and to **speed up developer workflow** by allowing for quick keyboard navigation.

## Hotkeys

The namespace (the first key of a keyboard shortcut) is configurable with the default option being `m`. If left blank in admin configuration, no namespace will be used. It's recommended to use a namespace to avoid conflicting with native browser & assistive technology hotkeys.

| Hotkey | Purpose |
| :------------------- | :----------------- |
| <kbd>?</kbd> | Show keyboard hotkey information modal
| <kbd>m+e</kbd> | Go to Account Dashboard
| <kbd>m+c</kbd> | Go to Checkout
| <kbd>m+i</kbd> | Open minicart
| <kbd>m+s</kbd> | Focus in Search box

> Every hotkey is configurable and be disabled.

## Support
